## PokéSearch

PokéSearch is a web app that allows users to search for pokémon using the PokéAPI.

## Features

- **Search pokémon**: Users can search for pokémon by typing the name, or part of the name, into an autocomplete input.
- **Image preloading**: Pokémon sprites are preloaded before displaying the data to improve visual performance and eliminate rendering delays caused by slow image loading.
- **Caching mechanism**: Previously searched pokémon are cached in memory to avoid unnecessary API requests and improve application performance.
- **Pokémon navigation**: Users can navigate between pokémon using the arrow buttons, which fetch the next or previous pokémon by ID.

## Tech Stack
